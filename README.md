Memory tests for class demonstrations of working memory capacity and principles of memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval

# How to use
Details of the 


# Data
The subfolder Data contains deidentified results from the memory tests when tried with 11 medical students. There are 4 separate files for the working memory tests with 5, 7, 9, and 11 items. Results from the recall test are in a separate file. This latter file has 30 columns named Q1-Q30, indicating whether answers were correct, and then 4 columns giving the fraction of correct answers for pictures that were shown ("seen"), shown only once ("unconsolidated"), shown twice ("consolidated"), or not shown ("unseen"). The students gave implied consent by participating in the demonstration, which was not a course requirement. Ethical review was not required since data could not be linked to individials.
